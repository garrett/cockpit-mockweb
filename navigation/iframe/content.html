<div class="inner-content">
  <p>
    Everything inside the red border is in the iframe. 
    Everything outside is the parent frame. 
  </p> 
  <p>
    The parent frame controls both the top and secondary menus by simply
    toggling a class on the body of each document.
  </p> 
  <p>
    (Animation, positioning, etc. is handled purely by CSS. Animation
    between outer and inner nav is purposely timed different, but can be
    in sync â€” or have no animation at all.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Ideally, the module in the sub-frame would pull in stock Cockpit CSS
    with the logic to handle the internal sub-navigation sidebar
    (responsiveness, animation, style). It could choose to handle it
    itself, however, as it is based purely on the classname in the body.
